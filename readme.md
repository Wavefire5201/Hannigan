# About this bot

## Inspiration

Chat GPT and Google Bard are language models so it made sense for us to utilize those language models to process text information that would be unfeasible for humans to process themselves. This is what led us to a Discord Bot. One of the most common uses for Discord bots are moderation of chat. We wanted to create a discord bot that would be more accurate in discerning the agreeableness of a users by implementing a language model into the bot.

## What it does

Hannigan is capable of moderating messages through a social credit system. The bot can provide intelligent responses to user messages, along with the ability to assess messages with a score, hence the social credit system. The bot can also act as a chatbot for entertainment in a separate discord channel.

## How we built it

We incorporated Google Bard and Perspective API into the bot where we have many different usages for services. Google Bard is used for regular chat activities and Perspective is used to monitor chat messages.

## Challenges we ran into

One of our biggest issues was being creative with our Discord bot, since we lacked many ideas at first. Slowly, we obtained more inspiration and ideas to implement into our bot.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to complete the project of our Discord Bot within two hours of the time frame. The Discord Bot is capable of functioning in different servers through repeated testing and debugging.

## What we learned

We learned to strengthen our Python abilities and work with API's through the creation of the Discord Bot.

## What's next for Hannigan

We're going to add more functionality in the future, such as ways to increase your credit score.

## Other info

This bot was created for the Martin High School Hackathon 2023. There were two prompts:

1. Since it's earth day, how can we encourage people to make the world a healthier and happier place to live in?
2. Make an application that best utilizes language learning models (ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc.)

This bot was based on the second prompt, which utilizes Google Bard and the Perspective API. This bot can rate messages sent by users based on their level of offensiveness in order to better moderate chat. The user can also talk to Bard within a specified channel or by using a command.
