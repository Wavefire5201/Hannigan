# About this bot

This bot was created for the Martin High School Hackathon 2023. There were two prompts:

1. Since it's earth day, how can we encourage people to make the world a healthier and happier place to live in?
2. Make an application that best utilizes language learning models (ChatGPT, Google Bard, etc.)

This bot was based on the second prompt, which utilizes Google Bard and the Perspective API. This bot can rate messages sent by users based on their level of offensiveness in order to better moderate chat. The user can also talk to Bard within a specified channel or by using a command.

Click [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099363267731804202&scope=bot&permissions=8) for the invite. The bot requires administrator perms because I didn't feel like manually checking every permission that we needed lmao.
